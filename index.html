	<h3>IT experience</h3>
		<i>I use computers daily, and as part of my course in Architecture I have used many computing programs
		<br> and have been hacking in minecraft for multiple years</i>
	<h3>Why I do course</h3>
		<mark>After 2 years of studying Architecture in Cardiff University as well as a few months in an internship
		<br> in the field in one of the most prestigious engineering companies, I decided that the industry wasn't 
		<br>quite for me. As my older brother is in the tech field, he recommended this to me</mark>
	<h4>What I hope to gain</h4>
		<del>Throughout this course, I wish to gain the knowledge to allow me to create 
		<br> websites, in particular expanding my portfolio of creative skills.</del>
